# Pie.
The cross-platform graphics toolkit.

Pie is a modern graphics API that allows you to write portable graphics code, able to run on many different systems. 

Featuring a modern, simple, safe, object-oriented approach, Pie is generally easier to use than other graphics APIs. Its code style is similar to Direct3D 11, however tasks such as device & swapchain creation, and swapchain resizing have been simplified.

### API support
Pie supports the following graphics APIs:
* Direct3D 11
* OpenGL 3.3
